===========

What is this?
---------------
This repository contains some of my solutions for the RubyQuiz problem set. I hope that someday my solutions may help someone learn Ruby.  I do not claim these solutions to be complete and/or perfect, but they should be in the ballpark.
I am also adding problems I have encountered during interviews for various software companies. Feel free to look over my solutions!
There are also solutions to some interview problems on my [BitBucket account](https://bitbucket.org/maxwellE).



Solved Problems
----------------
* Scrambler
* FizzBuzz
* Roman Numerals
* MadLibs (partially,  I dislike this problem)
* Anagrams, FB interview problem
* Meetings, FB interview problem
* SplitTheLoot (Does not work for all cases)
